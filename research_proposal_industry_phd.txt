DESIGNING A TOKEN INTERCHANGE SCHEME: LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT FOR AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

Research Question

How should Australian Payments Plus design a comprehensive token interchange scheme that effectively manages liquidity across its three-component response to the RBA's Project Acacia, ensuring resilient operations between traditional payment rails and emerging tokenised assets in an increasingly competitive global fintech landscape?

Motivation

Australian Payments Plus (AP+) operates as the architect and operator of Australia's domestic payment schemes, managing the critical infrastructure that enables billions of dollars in daily transactions. These schemes—the New Payments Platform (NPP), eftpos, and BPAY—represent sophisticated frameworks of technical standards, operational rules, and governance structures that have evolved over decades to ensure safe, efficient, and accessible payments for all Australians. Each scheme embodies deep institutional knowledge about balancing stakeholder interests, managing systemic risks, and maintaining public trust in the payment system.

The Reserve Bank of Australia's Project Acacia initiative marks a watershed moment in Australian monetary history. This comprehensive exploration of central bank digital currency and asset tokenisation, conducted in partnership with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre, challenges existing payment infrastructure to evolve beyond traditional account-based systems. For AP+, Project Acacia represents both a strategic imperative and an existential challenge: how to maintain relevance and centrality in a payment landscape that increasingly spans traditional and tokenised forms of value.

AP+'s response to Project Acacia encompasses three interconnected components that collectively aim to bridge the traditional and tokenised financial systems. The first component, a facility enabling transfers between NPP accounts and stablecoins, addresses the immediate need for interoperability between existing payment rails and emerging digital assets. This coin-to-account and account-to-coin functionality represents more than a technical bridge; it embodies a fundamental challenge in reconciling the finality and reversibility models of traditional banking with the immutable nature of blockchain transactions.

The second component, a token interchange for stablecoins and deposit tokens issued by authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), introduces unprecedented complexity in scheme design. Unlike traditional payment schemes that operate with a single form of money—commercial bank deposits—this interchange must accommodate multiple token types with varying risk profiles, regulatory treatments, and technical implementations. The proposal to use a CBDC-backed exchange asset as the settlement medium introduces both opportunities and challenges. While CBDC provides the ultimate risk-free settlement asset, its introduction creates new dependencies on RBA systems and policies that AP+ cannot control.

The third component, a settlement coordinator for operations involving both tokenised money and other tokenised assets, extends AP+'s remit beyond pure payments into the broader realm of digital asset transactions. This expansion requires careful consideration of AP+'s capabilities, regulatory mandate, and strategic positioning. The settlement coordinator must handle complex multi-asset transactions while maintaining the operational resilience expected of critical financial infrastructure.

The international fintech context adds urgency to AP+'s scheme development efforts. Global technology firms and cryptocurrency platforms are rapidly building cross-border payment solutions that bypass traditional infrastructure entirely. Ripple's blockchain-based payment network, despite regulatory challenges, processes billions in cross-border transfers. Circle's USDC stablecoin, with over $30 billion in circulation, enables instant global transfers outside traditional banking channels. Meta's discontinued Diem project, while unsuccessful, demonstrated the ambitions of technology platforms to create parallel payment systems. For AP+, the challenge extends beyond domestic competition to maintaining relevance in an increasingly borderless digital economy.

The liquidity management challenges across AP+'s three-component response are multifaceted and interconnected. The NPP-stablecoin bridge requires liquidity buffers in both traditional currency and digital tokens, creating new risks around asset-liability mismatches. Market volatility in cryptocurrency markets can rapidly deplete liquidity buffers, while traditional banking liquidity cannot be instantly converted to blockchain-based assets. The token interchange introduces even greater complexity, as liquidity must be maintained across multiple token types with different velocities and demand patterns. The CBDC-backed exchange asset, while providing stability, may face its own liquidity constraints depending on RBA issuance policies and access criteria.

The settlement coordinator component faces unique liquidity challenges in facilitating transactions between tokenised money and other tokenised assets. Unlike pure payment transactions, asset exchanges involve valuation risks, settlement timing mismatches, and potential market manipulation. Traditional payment systems benefit from clear separation between payment and securities settlement infrastructure, with established protocols for delivery-versus-payment. The convergence of these functions in a tokenised environment requires new approaches to liquidity provisioning and risk management.

From a technological perspective, implementing these three components requires navigating fundamental tensions in blockchain architecture. Public blockchains offer transparency and interoperability but lack the performance and privacy required for national payment infrastructure. Private or permissioned blockchains provide control and performance but risk creating new silos that defeat the purpose of tokenisation. Hybrid architectures introduce complexity in governance and technical integration. The choice of blockchain platform affects not only technical capabilities but also liquidity dynamics, as different platforms have varying levels of token standardisation and cross-chain interoperability.

The regulatory landscape presents additional complexity for AP+'s scheme design. While traditional payment schemes operate under well-established regulatory frameworks, the tokenised components enter uncharted territory. The NPP-stablecoin bridge must navigate anti-money laundering requirements across different regulatory perimeters. The token interchange raises questions about systemic risk designation and prudential requirements for liquidity providers. The settlement coordinator potentially triggers securities law considerations when handling tokenised assets beyond pure payment tokens. AP+ must design schemes that satisfy current regulatory requirements while maintaining flexibility for inevitable regulatory evolution.

Approach

This industry PhD research adopts a systems engineering approach to scheme design, recognising the interconnected nature of AP+'s three-component response to Project Acacia. The research methodology emphasises iterative design, stakeholder engagement, and practical validation through prototyping and simulation.

The initial phase involves comprehensive mapping of liquidity flows across the three components. This includes analyzing how liquidity moves between traditional NPP settlement accounts and blockchain-based token pools, identifying potential bottlenecks and failure points. The research will develop quantitative models for liquidity demand across different scenarios, from normal market conditions to stress events. These models must account for the unique characteristics of tokenised systems, including the inability to create temporary liquidity through credit extension.

International benchmarking forms a crucial component of the research approach. This involves detailed analysis of global token interchange initiatives, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Guardian, the Bank for International Settlements' Project mBridge, and the European Central Bank's exploration of wholesale CBDC for securities settlement. The research will extract design patterns and lessons learned from these initiatives while recognising the unique characteristics of the Australian market.

The design phase will develop integrated scheme rules that span all three components while maintaining appropriate separation of concerns. For the NPP-stablecoin bridge, this includes protocols for transaction authorisation, fund locking, and atomic execution. The token interchange requires sophisticated matching engines, liquidity pooling mechanisms, and circuit breakers for abnormal market conditions. The settlement coordinator needs frameworks for transaction sequencing, netting optimisation, and fail-safe procedures.

Stakeholder engagement through AP+'s member organisations provides critical input for scheme design. Financial institutions bring perspectives on operational integration, risk management, and commercial viability. Technology partners contribute expertise on blockchain platforms and integration patterns. Regulatory authorities provide guidance on compliance requirements and systemic risk concerns. This collaborative approach ensures that scheme design balances theoretical optimality with practical implementability.

Prototyping and simulation enable validation of design choices before full implementation. The research will develop functional prototypes of key scheme components, particularly focusing on liquidity management mechanisms. Agent-based simulations will test system behavior under various market conditions and attack scenarios. Stress testing will evaluate resilience to liquidity shocks, platform failures, and coordinated market manipulation.

Expected Outcomes

This industry PhD research will deliver a comprehensive framework for AP+'s token interchange scheme that addresses the complex challenges of bridging traditional and tokenised payment systems. The primary outcome will be detailed scheme rules and technical specifications for all three components, developed through rigorous analysis and stakeholder consultation.

For liquidity management, the research will produce sophisticated frameworks tailored to each component's unique requirements. The NPP-stablecoin bridge will feature dynamic liquidity buffers that adjust based on transaction patterns and market volatility. The token interchange will implement multi-tier liquidity pools with automated rebalancing mechanisms. The settlement coordinator will employ predictive analytics to anticipate liquidity needs across different asset classes.

Technical deliverables include reference architectures demonstrating how the three components integrate with existing AP+ infrastructure and external blockchain platforms. Smart contract templates will standardise key operations while allowing innovation at the participant level. Performance benchmarks will establish baseline expectations for transaction throughput and latency across different operational scenarios.

The strategic impact extends beyond technical implementation to positioning AP+ as a global leader in payment system evolution. By successfully implementing a comprehensive response to tokenisation, AP+ demonstrates how incumbent infrastructure providers can adapt to technological disruption while maintaining systemic stability. This provides a model for other countries grappling with similar challenges and potentially positions Australian financial infrastructure as an export opportunity.

From a regulatory perspective, the research will contribute concrete proposals for oversight frameworks that balance innovation with stability. By demonstrating how scheme rules can embed regulatory requirements while enabling new forms of value exchange, the research supports the development of principles-based regulation suitable for rapidly evolving technology.

The research also addresses the competitive dynamics of the global fintech landscape. By creating open, interoperable infrastructure for token interchange, AP+ provides a platform for Australian financial institutions to compete effectively with global technology firms. The scheme design emphasises network effects and ecosystem development, recognising that infrastructure success depends on broad participation and continuous innovation.

Ultimately, this industry PhD research represents a critical contribution to Australia's financial future. As the boundaries between traditional and digital finance continue to blur, robust infrastructure becomes even more essential. By combining AP+'s operational expertise with rigorous academic research and international best practices, this project will deliver practical solutions that serve the national interest while positioning Australia at the forefront of global payment innovation. The three-component approach to Project Acacia, with carefully designed liquidity management across all elements, ensures that Australia's payment system remains safe, efficient, and competitive in an increasingly tokenised world.
