\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Digital liquidity today spans central-bank RTGS systems, ACH/card schemes, commercial-bank cores, super-app wallets, public blockchains, L2s, DeFi protocols, stablecoins, tokenised MMFs, and multi-CBDC platforms. Each comes with its own terminology and risk model. Systems researchers see ``RTGS vs DeFi vs CBDC vs stablecoins'' as qualitatively different beasts, and lack a unified way to compare them, build tools over them, or formally reason about their behaviour.

This paper defines a \textbf{Systematisation of Knowledge (SoK)} for \textit{digital liquidity instruments and infrastructures} aimed at a computer-systems audience. Its core contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{Balance-State Transition Event (BSTE)} model: A universal, event-level state-machine model for monetary ledgers, with three irreducible primitives: \textbf{OWNERSHIP\_TRANSFER (P1)}, \textbf{ENCUMBRANCE\_ADJUST (P2)}, and \textbf{SUPPLY\_ADJUST (P3)}.
    \item A \textbf{Core Digital Liquidity Profile (C1--C20)}: A finite feature space that classifies any instrument--infrastructure pair along asset, ledger, access, trust, privacy, ordering, and failure dimensions.
    \item An explicit \textbf{alignment with Basel III, PFMI, ISO 20022, and ISO 4217}, showing how existing standards map into this state-centric view.
    \item A view of the SoK as a \textbf{state-machine type system} for smart contracts and protocols: given a contract's SoK type, we can derive obligations and verify them with formal methods.
    \item A formal approach to \textbf{Liquidity Calculus}, providing mathematical definitions for digital LCR/NSFR and optimization costs.
    \item A comprehensive library of \textbf{20 case mappings} (Fedwire, ACH, Bitcoin, Tornado Cash, etc.) with the full 20-dimensional profile for each.
\end{enumerate}

The result is a \textbf{computational ontology} and \textbf{front-end semantic type system for digital liquidity state machines}, designed to plug into monitoring, optimisation, protocol design, and formal verification workflows.

\section{Introduction}

Digital liquidity infrastructure has exploded in diversity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Central-bank infrastructures (RTGS, wholesale CBDC pilots, multi-CBDC platforms).
    \item Commercial-bank rails (ACH, card schemes, instant payments, tokenised deposits).
    \item FMIs (CLS, CCP cash ledgers, CHESS-style settlement systems).
    \item Public-chain ecosystems (BTC, ETH, L2 rollups, DeFi AMMs, lending protocols).
    \item Tokenised cash/collateral networks (stablecoins, ERC-4626 vaults, tokenised MMFs).
    \item Privacy-preserving networks (Mixers, Shielded Pools, ZK-Rollups).
\end{itemize}

These are usually analysed in silos: an economist might compare RTGS and ACH; a DeFi researcher might analyse AMMs; an applied-crypto person might scrutinise bridges. There is no unified, technically precise \textbf{design space} for ``digital liquidity'' in which all of these systems can be represented, compared, and reasoned about.

From a systems perspective, there are three core problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No common event model:} ISO 20022 and SWIFT provide rich messaging schemas, but they are \textit{not} ledger state models. On-chain systems have tx logs, but semantics differ (account vs UTXO vs smart-contract state). We want a single event-level abstraction that covers RTGS, ACH, DeFi, and Lightning.
    \item \textbf{No shared feature space:} We lack a finite set of dimensions that capture what matters for digital liquidity — not only asset nature, but privacy models, ordering mechanisms (MEV), and failure modes.
    \item \textbf{No ``type system'' for contract behaviour:} Languages like Solidity or Rust tell you \textit{how} a contract is implemented. They do not tell you \textit{what kind of instrument or rail it is supposed to be} (e.g., fully-reserved stablecoin vs unsecured credit token) nor what invariants that implies.
\end{enumerate}

This paper addresses these problems by defining a universal \textbf{Balance-State Transition Event (BSTE)} model (§3) and a \textbf{Core Digital Liquidity Profile} (C1--C20) (§4). Together, these constitute a \textbf{formal ontology} that acts as a semantic type system for digital finance.

% =============================================================================
\section{Background and Requirements}

\subsection{Digital Liquidity and Instruments}
We use ``digital liquidity'' as a broadly umbrella for the short-horizon, transactional layer of modern finance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item monetary claims used as \textbf{settlement assets} (central-bank reserves, CBDCs, tokenised MMFs),
    \item \textbf{payment instruments} (bank deposits, e-money, stablecoins, platform balances),
    \item \textbf{collateral instruments} used in secured funding (repo, margin, RWA vault shares),
    \item and the infrastructures that move, encumber, and settle them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State Machines vs Messaging Layers}
At the highest level, a \textbf{ledger} is a \textbf{state machine}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State}: for a given $(ledger\_id, asset\_code)$, balances per account (available, reservation, collateral, etc.) and summary variables.
    \item \textbf{Transitions}: events that update this state.
\end{itemize}

Different technologies give different encodings (Account vs UTXO vs ZK-Commitment). By contrast, systems like SWIFT + ISO 20022 are primarily \textbf{messaging networks}. They define messages, but not a canonical `State`. Our SoK treats each ledger as a state machine with a BSTE log.

% =============================================================================
\section{Balance-State Transition Event (BSTE) Model}

\subsection{Intuition}
A \textbf{Balance-State Transition Event (BSTE)} is a single \textbf{atomic change} in balances of \textit{one asset} on \textit{one ledger}. If you replay all BSTEs in time order, you reconstruct the ledger's monetary state. This abstracts over Account-based, UTXO-based, and Zero-Knowledge (commitment-based) ledgers.

\subsection{Unified Logical Schema}
This schema merges the rigorous data requirements of ISO 20022 with the privacy and ordering primitives required for distributed ledger technology (DLT) and ZK systems.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
struct BSTE:
    # --- Identity & Time ---
    event_id: string        # UUID, TxHash, or UETR
    ledger_id: string       # "CB.RTGS/US", "DLT/ETH", "BANK/DE"
    t_occurred: timestamp   # ISO 8601 / RFC3339

    # --- Ordering (for Distributed Systems) ---
    sequence_index: uint64  # Block height + Tx Index (Ordering)
    causal_ref: list[ID]    # Vector clock / dependency graph

    # --- The Primitive ---
    op_kind: enum { OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER, ENCUMBRANCE_ADJUST, SUPPLY_ADJUST }

    # --- Asset & Privacy ---
    asset_code: string      # ISO 4217, ISIN, or Contract Address
    privacy_mode: enum { TRANSPARENT, CONFIDENTIAL_AMT, SHIELDED }
    
    # If transparent:
    amount_scalar: decimal
    # If confidential (ZK):
    amount_commitment: bytes 
    proof_ref: string

    # --- Accounts & Buckets ---
    # Can be an address, or a ZK Nullifier/Commitment hash
    src_account: string or bytes or NULL
    src_balance_type: enum { available, reservation, collateral, escrow, channel }

    dst_account: string or bytes or NULL
    dst_balance_type: enum { available, reservation, collateral, escrow, channel }

    # --- Global State Deltas ---
    supply_delta: decimal   # Net change to total supply (for P3)
    lock_delta: decimal     # Net change to encumbered quantity (for P2)

    # --- Linkage & Atomicity ---
    link_id: string         # Groups atomic bundles (e.g. PvP, Flash Loan)
    atomicity: enum { none, PvP, DvP, HTLC, protocol_atomic }

    # --- Evidence / Upstream Messaging (ISO 20022 Alignment) ---
    message_ref: json or NULL  # References to pacs/pain/camt or SWIFT MT
    purpose_code: string       # ISO 20022 <Purp> (e.g., "SALA", "COLL")
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Three Irreducible Primitives}
Every BSTE is exactly one of three primitives:

\subsubsection*{P1. OWNERSHIP\_TRANSFER}
Move spendable units between accounts \textbf{without} changing total supply or system-wide encumbrance.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constraints: $supply\_delta = 0$, $lock\_delta = 0$.
    \item Instances: RTGS payment, ACH posting, BTC transfer, Lightning channel rebalance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{P2. ENCUMBRANCE\_ADJUST}
Change how much balance is \textbf{free vs encumbered} (reservation/collateral/escrow) \textbf{without} changing ownership or total supply.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constraints: $supply\_delta = 0$, $lock\_delta \neq 0$.
    \item Instances: Card authorisation, Repo collateral pledge, Lightning Harming Logic (HTLC), Optimistic Bridge lock.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{P3. SUPPLY\_ADJUST}
Increase or decrease total recognised supply of a given asset on a given ledger (mint/burn).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constraints: $lock\_delta = 0$, $supply\_delta \neq 0$.
    \item Instances: Central bank reserve creation, Stablecoin mint/burn, Tokenised MMF share issuance, Wrapping/Unwrapping assets.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\section{Alignment with Regulatory Frameworks}

\subsection{Basel III (LCR / NSFR)}
Basel III reasoning hinges on HQLA quality and encumbrance. Our profile supports this via derived metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Digital HQLA:} Using \texttt{liquidity\_backing} and \texttt{asset\_nature} to classify tiers.
    \item \textbf{Free Liquidity:} $F(t) = Supply(t) - Encumbered(t)$, where Encumbered is derived from P2 events.
    \item \textbf{Funding Structure:} \texttt{credit\_sources} distinguishes between unsecured interbank funding (run risk) and secured funding (repo/SFT).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PFMI (CPSS--IOSCO)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Principle 8 (Finality):} Mapped directly to \texttt{finality\_kind} and \texttt{safety\_fallback}.
    \item \textbf{Principle 5 (Collateral):} P2 events allow on-chain collateral (vaults, channels) to be mapped into PFMI frameworks.
    \item \textbf{Principle 2 (Governance):} Mapped to \texttt{governance\_model} and \texttt{upgrade\_timelock}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ISO 20022 Alignment}
ISO 20022 provides a \textbf{message model}, not a ledger state model. BSTE is its \textbf{state-side dual}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \texttt{pacs.008} settlement leg corresponds to a P1 OWNERSHIP\_TRANSFER.
    \item Securities/corporate action messages correspond to P3 SUPPLY\_ADJUST and associated P1 transfers.
    \item Status reports (\texttt{camt.053}) correspond to state read-outs post-BSTE.
\end{itemize}
This allows DLT instruments to be embedded into ISO 20022 workflows by mapping BSTEs to the appropriate message category.

% =============================================================================
\section{SoK as a State-Machine Type System}

Languages like Solidity define implementation; the SoK defines the \textit{intended instrument type}. This allows us to pose the question: \textit{Does the design actually satisfy the obligations implied by its type?}

\subsection{The Five-Step Evaluation Pipeline}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Classify (C1--C20):} Fill out the profile for the target system. For example, a stablecoin might declare itself \texttt{stablecoin\_fiat}, \texttt{fully\_reserved}, \texttt{burn\_mint} bridge.
    
    \item \textbf{Derive Obligations:} A \texttt{fully\_reserved} stablecoin implies $Supply \leq Reserves$. A \texttt{lock\_mint} bridge implies $Supply_{wrapped} \leq Locked_{native}$. A \texttt{dao\_token\_vote} governance model implies that logic changes must pass a voting threshold.
    
    \item \textbf{Map Primitives:} Map the contract's behavioral surface (functions like \texttt{deposit}, \texttt{swap}) to sequences of P1/P2/P3 events.
    
    \item \textbf{Verify (Model Checking):} Encode the state machine and obligations in a formalism (e.g., TLA+, Alloy) to check if the primitives satisfy the obligations under all reachable states.
    
    \item \textbf{Compare:} Evaluate designs that share the same type but differ in governance or ordering risks (e.g., two stablecoins with different \texttt{sanction\_capability}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conceptual TLA+ Mapping}

While full code is outside the scope of this SoK, the BSTE model maps naturally to TLA+ (Temporal Logic of Actions):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Variables:} \texttt{balance[account]}, \texttt{supply}, \texttt{reserve}.
    \item \textbf{Actions:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{Transfer(from, to, amt)} $\rightarrow$ P1 (Ownership Transfer).
        \item \texttt{Mint(amt, to)} $\rightarrow$ P3 (Supply Adjust).
        \item \texttt{Lock(amt, user)} $\rightarrow$ P2 (Encumbrance Adjust).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Invariants:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conservation: \texttt{supply = Sum(balance)}.
        \item Backing: \texttt{supply <= reserve}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The model checker then explores all sequences of actions (including adversarial ordering) to find states where invariants like "Backing" are violated.

\subsection{Formal Subtyping: Liskov Substitution for Money}
We propose a formal definition for instrument equivalence:
\begin{quote}
    \textit{System $S$ is a subtype of System $T$ ($S <: T$) if $S$ preserves all invariants of $T$ under all failure modes defined in $T$.}
\end{quote}
For example, a Stablecoin is a subtype of `Commercial Deposit` only if it maintains par redemption under the failure mode of the issuer's insolvency (often requiring bankruptcy remoteness, captured in \texttt{custody\_model}).

% =============================================================================
\section{System-Level Applications}

\subsection{Unified Liquidity Monitoring}
By instrumenting systems to emit BSTEs, we can build cross-rail observatories. A central bank could monitor $Supply(USD)$ across RTGS, Tokenised Deposits, and Stablecoins in real-time, detecting leaks or unbacked credit expansion.

\subsection{Liquidity Calculus and Optimisation}
The BSTE stream allows us to define rigorous metrics for digital liquidity optimization.

\subsubsection{Digital LCR/NSFR}
For participant $i$ and asset $a$:
\[
\text{LCR}_{i,a}(t) = \frac{\text{HQLA}^{\mathrm{unenc}}_{i,a}(t)}{\text{NetOutflows}_{i,a}(t, t+30d)}
\]
where $\text{HQLA}^{\mathrm{unenc}}$ is inferred from C1 (\texttt{asset\_nature}) and C14 (Encumbrance State derived from P2 events).

\subsubsection{Cost of Encumbrance}
For liquidity saving mechanisms (LSMs), we can define the cost of encumbrance for participant $i$ as:
\[
\text{Cost}_i = \int K_{i}(t) \, dt
\]
where $K$ is the encumbered quantity. The optimization problem then becomes: Find a sequence of P1/P2/P3 events that satisfies all payment obligations while minimizing $\int K(t) dt$.

\subsection{Power: Messaging vs. Shared Ledgers}
The framework clarifies where \textbf{power} resides—specifically the power to censor.

\subsubsection{SWIFT (Messaging)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Profile:} \texttt{ledger\_tech = none}, \texttt{messaging = offledger}, \texttt{censorship = network\_edge}.
    \item \textbf{Power:} Sanctions occur by preventing messages from flowing. However, the ledger state remains distributed across banks; SWIFT cannot unilaterally mutate a bank's balance sheet.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{mBridge / Multi-CBDC (Shared Ledger)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Profile:} \texttt{ledger\_tech = dlt\_permissioned}, \texttt{messaging = onchain}, \texttt{censorship = builder/contract}.
    \item \textbf{Power:} Authorities act as operators of the shared state machine. They can not only block transactions but potentially freeze or redirect assets directly via the consensus mechanism or smart contract logic.
\end{itemize}
This shift from \textit{messaging coalitions} to \textit{ledger coalitions} represents a fundamental change in the architecture of financial sanctions.
